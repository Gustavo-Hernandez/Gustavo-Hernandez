### Hey! ðŸ‘‹, I'm Gus.

I'm a Computer Science student at the TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey!
I'm coursing my seventh semester and planning to graduate in 2021!


âš¡ I've worked as a freelancer developing an App using React-Native, Firebase and a couple of magic...

âš¡ Also, I was part of a team that built an educational game that you can check here -->  https://vivarama.global/index.php/alebrijes/

âš¡ I've recently developed a POS system and an administrative system with React JS that lets you control the offers of a store!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a little bit of Data Science...

 I've completed this course... and planning to finish the rest of them! --> https://coursera.org/share/48a91daf39491901c66b96594034f5b1
